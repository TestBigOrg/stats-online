If you find yourself asking the question, \"do I have enough data?\" you'll be able to answer your question with this tool.\n\n\n#### Minimum Sample Sizes\nThe calculation of a minimum sample size a function of your samples _Degrees of Freedom_, _Standard Deviation_, and _T-Critical Value_, which is a function of those _Degrees of Freedom_ and your desired _Confidence_ level.  \n\n\n#### Usage\nWhen you call the main function in `index.js`, you'll need to provide a _sample_ (array), a _confidence_ value (float), and an _error tolerance_ (int). \n\nThe following code asks the question, \"If this is my sample, how many observations do I need to estimate the population average +/- 3, with 90% confidence.\n```\nvar sizer = require('sample-sizer');\nvar minimumSize1 = sizer([1,2,3,2,1,2,3,99], .9, 3);\n```\n\nIf the number you get is less than the length of your sample array, you need to increase your sample size! You can't be (as) confident (as you want to be) that your data is representative of the population.\n",
